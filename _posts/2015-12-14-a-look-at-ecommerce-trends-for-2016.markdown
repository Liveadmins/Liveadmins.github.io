Shopping online brings a lot of convenience for customers which is why there is an ever increase in the number of eCommerce companies. With so much competition, online entrepreneurs need to keep themselves constantly updated with the latest trends in order to grow their business and increase revenue. Here is a look at some of hottest eCommerce trends to look out for in 2016. 

<h3>Mobile Shopping Will Become Dominant</h3>

All trends for 2016 indicate that mobile shopping is significantly going to rise. Though a large part of e-commerce traffic by the end of 2015 is already from mobile devices, this percentage would significantly increase in 2016. By the end of 2016 mobile commerce i.e. apps for androids and apple devices would be dominating the internet commerce industry. In a recent research report by Forrester published on Mobile Commerce Daily™ it has been predicted that mobile commerce sales would reach $142B in 2016. In another report by Forester published on CNBC, consumers will begin to demand a more streamlined experience on mobile devices in 2016.

<h3>Online Sales Will Hit Record Levels</h3>

With the overwhelming number of new e-commerce companies opening up, there has been a significant increase in online sales too. A recent post published in Forbes suggests that US online retail sales would reach $370b by 2017 which seems quite true keeping in mind the current growth rate of e-commerce industry. In another research published by Rainmaker Labs, it has been said that 192 million people will primarily be online shoppers by 2016. The number of online shoppers is increasing significantly because online retailers are significantly improving their websites in terms of layout design as well as technology.

<h3>8 Product Categories That Will Boom</h3>
